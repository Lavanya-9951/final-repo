The web application “Pocket Mood Garden” is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a single-page project. It allows users to record their daily mood by entering a one-word emotion, selecting an intensity level, and adding optional notes. All the data is stored securely in the browser using localStorage, ensuring privacy without needing a server. The unique feature of this application is the virtual plant that grows with each entry—its stem, leaves, and flowers visually represent the user’s consistency in mood tracking. Additional features like quick actions (Water, Sun, Cheer), an entry history calendar, and export to JSON make it interactive and useful for self-reflection. The clean design is achieved with CSS grid layouts, styled cards, and smooth transitions, making the application both functional and visually engaging.
